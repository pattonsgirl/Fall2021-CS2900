- For the two container techologies choosen in Project 2:

- Write samples of how the recipe files work.
    - Think psudeo-code style - I don't need a working project, I need a quick lookup of what goes in the recipe (RUN, COPY, etc.)

- How to build from a recipe file

- Networking and containers

- Running containers without root (rootless container)

- Create a recipes (for each container platform) for a project of your own.
    - what base image you selected and why
    - what parts of your recipe file were needed for the container to have the right libraries for your project
    - how you copied your project into the container

- Use a container registry to publish your container image

- Given recipes, detect vulnerability(s) introduced?
