## Objectives

- for two different container engines:
  - investigate networking options
  - investigate a container vulnerability scanner

## Project Setup

Your deliverable for this project is once more documentation. You can use the below as a template of what your documentation needs.

This will look really slick if you start using markdown. For example:  
`$ something I want to look command liney`

```
some sample
output text
could go in this
```

Store screenshots in a folder in your repo, then refence them:
`![a photo could go here](../../Images/markdown-demo.png)`

## Project Description

1. Investigate container networking.

   - For Docker, for example, there exists three networking modes - host, none, and bridge.
   - For the two engines of your choice (of which Docker can be one choice) state:
     - What networking mode(s) are supported and their capabilities
     - What networking mode is used by default
     - How to run the container and bind a host port to the container port

2. Investigate vulnerability scanners.

- [Aqua Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.21.0/)

- Give a brief write up about what each scans and which container engines are supported.
